        NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming. Especially if you’ve never been.<br>
        Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience.<br>
        By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut. You’ll have an unforgettable experience!<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

        If you’re lucky or connected, you can get an invite sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or<br>
        connected my first 2 years, so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are the most<br>
        important to you and make a schedule, and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about<br>
        blowing your cash the whole time, you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and<br>
        prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!<br>

    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

        “Always be true to your own sense of style; if you don’t, you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show.<br>
        Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through<br>
        their new lines. Also, it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously, you<br>
        want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”<br>
